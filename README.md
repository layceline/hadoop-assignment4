# hadoop-assignment4

<p>To add a user, you need to add him with a BFF that is part of the friends network. In my hbase, I already created 4 people, alex, celine, fanny and ophelia.</p>

<p>Adding information and friends in my hbase works well, but when I want to retrieve the data, the conversion of the bytes codes and the encoding of the terminal are influing on the display, which is not as good</p>

<p>For the jar file, I didn't manage to run it on the server without the library dependencies. So my jar contains all the library needed, eventhough I added the hadoop classpath and hbase classpath in my Maven manifest</p>
